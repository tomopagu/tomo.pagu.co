        <p>I'm a frontend developer with a focus on building components with javascript frameworks like reactjs & vuejs along with knowledge of a combination of most css solutions (css, scss, less, stylus, postcss, css in js). Storybook is ‚ù§. I do also a little bit of backend work, either in javascript with node or php where I use laravel.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, I'm a big fan of things japanese but mostly enjoy music (and mostly IDOL (<a href="https://tomoshi.uchuu.io" title="oshis">oshi-list</a>) at that)) and aesthetics. I try to get over there every 2 years at least and I'm trying to learn the language via a tutor, self teaching and going to meetups.</p>
        <p>I also play drums occasionally, used to be in a band but I still keep playing to keep skills up, because of that I do finger drum in the office (sorry not sorry). You can see what I'm currently listening to below or via <a href={this.props.me.contact.lastfm} title="My Lastfm">my Lastfm</a>.</p>
